Making education accessible, proactive, and insightful.

About The Project
Education systems have seen limited structural change despite rapid technological growth. EduBridge was born from a simple realization: students with learning differences (such as dyslexia) are just as capable as their peers but often require different modes of engagement—like extra time or audio support—to reach their potential.

This platform bridges the gap between student needs and teacher insights. It is a school-integrated ecosystem that democratizes access to learning materials through OCR-based simplification, multilingual support, and Text-to-Speech (TTS).

More importantly, Readease shifts the dynamic from reactive to proactive. Instead of waiting for students to ask for help, the platform analyzes what students are trying to learn and highlights gaps to teachers, allowing educators to address issues before they become roadblocks.

 Key Features
 For Students:
Smart Document Simplification: Upload complex documents/images. The system uses OCR to extract text and AI to simplify the language into digestible summaries.

Accessibility First: Integrated Text-to-Speech (TTS) allows students to listen to content if reading is difficult or fatiguing.

Multilingual Support: Break down language barriers with instant translation and localized support.

Doubt Clearing: a dedicated section to raise queries on specific topics.

Interactive Quizzes: Take scheduled quizzes created by teachers to test knowledge in a low-stress environment.

For Teachers & Schools:
Automated Insights (The "Gap" Detector): The platform captures short summaries of the content students are processing. This aggregates data to show teachers exactly where the class is struggling without violating student privacy by storing full original documents.

Effortless Management: Easily upload notes, assignments, and creating quizzes.

Automated Grading: Quizzes are auto-graded, providing instant performance metrics and reducing manual administrative work.

Proactive Intervention: Identify learning trends across the class to address widespread confusion during lectures.

How It Works:
School Registration: Schools sign up and onboard their faculty and student database.

Student Access: Students log in under their school credentials. They can upload study materials they are struggling with.

Processing:

The system scans the document (OCR).

It simplifies the text and offers audio options.

It generates a metadata summary of the topic.

The Feedback Loop: Teachers receive a dashboard view of these summaries. If 40% of the class is trying to simplify "Thermodynamics," the teacher knows to review that topic in the next class.
